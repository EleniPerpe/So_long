so_long is a simple 2D game where the player controls a character to collect all items (collectibles) on a map and escape to the exit. The game is built using the MiniLibX library for graphics and input handling. The player moves through a map composed of walls, empty spaces, collectibles, and an exit, using the W, A, S, D keys for movement. The goal is to collect all the items and find the shortest path to the exit. The program ensures that the map is valid and enforces game rules such as walls preventing movement and proper map boundaries.
